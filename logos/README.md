Research Computing Logos
========================

All logos were downloaded as a zip file from the official ASU repository
[widen][1]. The logo names have been simplified to  
`ASURC_<text color>[shape]_<resolution>.png`   
and only the `png` versions
are exposed in this repo. All backgrounds are transparent. There are
several options for text color, shape, and resolution:

* Text color: `color` (maroon & gold), `white`, or `black`.
* Shape: default rectangular (horz) or square (vert).
* Resolution: 600 or 150 pixels-per-inch 

Samples 
-------

Below are samples of the logos, shown at 600 pixel-per-inch resolution.
The square format is shown for each text color option first.
