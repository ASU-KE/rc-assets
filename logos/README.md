Research Computing Logos
========================

Most repository logos were downloaded as a zip file from the official 
ASU repository [widen][1] (the exception is the custom banner jpg, 
`ASURC_custom_gradient_banner.jpg`). The logo names have been 
simplified to  

```
ASURC_<text color>[shape]_<resolution>.png
```

and only the `png` versions are exposed in this repo. All backgrounds
are transparent. There are several options for text color, shape, and
resolution:

* Text color: `color` (maroon & gold), `white`, or `black`.
* Shape: default rectangular (horz) or square (vert).
* Resolution: 600 or 150 pixels-per-inch 

Samples 
-------

Below are samples of the logos, shown at 600 pixel-per-inch resolution.
The square format is shown for each text color option first.

<div float="left">
  <img height=90 src="ASURC_color_square_600.png" alt="Color, Square" >
  <img height=90 src="ASURC_color_600.png"        alt="Color"         >
  <img height=90 src="ASURC_white_square_600.png" alt="White, Square" >
  <img height=90 src="ASURC_white_600.png"        alt="White"         >
  <img height=90 src="ASURC_black_square_600.png" alt="Black, Square" >
  <img height=90 src="ASURC_black_600.png"        alt="Black"         >
