Research Computing Logos
========================

All logos were downloaded as a zip file from the official ASU repository
[1](widen). The logo names have been simplified to
`ASURC_<text color>[shape]_<resolution>.png` and only the `png` versions
are exposed in this repo. All backgrounds are transparent. There are
several options for text color, shape, and resolution:

* Text color: `color` (maroon & gold), `white`, or `black`.
* Shape: default rectangular (horz) or square (vert).
* Resolution: 600 or 150 pixels-per-inch
